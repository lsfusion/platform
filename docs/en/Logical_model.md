The logical model is traditionally divided into two parts:

### [Domain logic](Domain_logic.md)

It determines what information the system stores and what you can do with this information. This logic is also often called domain-specific logic.

### [View logic](View_logic.md)

It includes everything related to the display of information to entities using the information system â€“ users and other information systems.
