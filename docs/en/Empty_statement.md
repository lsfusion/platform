title: 'Empty statement'
---

*Empty statement* - a special statement that consists of a single semicolon.

### Syntax

```
;
```

### Description

An empty statement is intended to prevent extra semicolons from being diagnosed as an error. For example, statements in which the last character is a closing brace should not end with a semicolon. If a semicolon is inserted, however, no error will be thrown, since this will be interpreted as two different statements. 

### Example

```lsf
CLASS Result {
    yes 'Yes',
    no 'No'
};  // semicolon is not needed here, but its presence is not an error

;;;; // this is valid lsFusion code
```
