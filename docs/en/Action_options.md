title: 'Action options'
---

When declaring an [action](Actions.md) in the [`ACTION` statement](ACTION_statement.md) a certain set of *action options* may be specified at the end of the declaration. 

## Syntax

Options are listed one after another in arbitrary order, separated by spaces or line feeds:

```
propertyOption1 ... propertyOptionN
```

The following set of options is supported (the syntax of each option is indicated on a separate line):

```
IN groupName
viewType
ON eventType { actionOperator }
CHANGEKEY key [SHOW | HIDE]
ASON eventType [ACTION] propertyId
IMAGE path
CONFIRM
```

## Description and parameters

- `IN groupName`

    Specifying the [group of properties and actions](Groups_of_properties_and_actions.md) to which the action belongs. If the option is not specified, then the action will belong by default to the `System.private` group.

    - `groupName`
    
        A group name. [Composite ID](IDs.md#cid).

### Interactive view block

- `viewType`

    Specifying the type of the [action view](Interactive_view.md#property) when added to the form.

    - `GRID` - table column
    - `TOOLBAR` - toolbar
    - `PANEL` - panel

  It is similar to specifying the viewType option in the [property block](Properties_and_actions_block.md) of the [`FORM` statement](FORM_statement.md). Thus, if this option is not specified either in the action options or in the property block directly on the form, the [default view](Interactive_view.md#property) of the action display group on the form is used.

- `ON eventType { actionOperator }`

    Specifying an action that will be the default handler of a certain [event](Form_events.md) for all the interactive views of this action. Can be overridden in the property block of the `FORM` statement.

    - `eventType`

        A [form event](Form_events.md) type. It is specified by one of the keywords:

        - `CHANGE` - occurs when the user tries to change the value of the specified property
        - `CHANGEWYS` - occurs when the user tries to change the value of the specified property using a special input mechanism. You can read more in the description of the [form events](Form_events.md) 
        - `GROUPCHANGE` - occurs when the user tries to change the property value for all objects in the table (group editing)
        - `EDIT` - occurs when the user tries to edit the object that is the value of the specified property
        - `CONTEXTMENU [caption]` - the user has selected the specified item in the property context menu on the form. If necessary, you can also define the caption of this menu item ([string literal](Literals.md#strliteral)). If it is not specified, then, by default, it will be the same as the action caption.

    - `actionOperator`

        A [context-dependent action operator](Action_operators.md#contextdependent). An operator that defines the action executed on an event. You can use the parameters of the property itself as operator parameters.

- `ASON eventType [ACTION] propertyId`

    Specifies that this action will be the default handler of a certain [event](Form_events.md) for all the interactive views of the specified property or action. Can be overridden in the [property and action block](Properties_and_actions_block.md) of the `FORM` statement. 

    - `eventType`

        Similar to the `ON` block.

    - `propertyId`

        An [ID of the property or action](IDs.md#propertyid) for which the created action will be executed when the specified form event occurs.

    - `ACTION`

        Keyword. If specified, it is considered that the action is set in `propertyId`. If not specified, it is initially considered that a property is defined in `propertyId`; otherwise, if no property is found, it is considered that an action is specified in `propertyId`.

- `IMAGE path`

    Specifies the file with the image to be displayed as an action icon.

    - `path`
     
        The relative path to the file. [String literal](Literals.md#strliteral). The path is specified relative to the `images` folder.

### `DESIGN` statement default values block

- `CHANGEKEY key [SHOW | HIDE]`

    Specifies a [keyboard shortcut](Form_events.md#keyboard) which triggers this action. Sets the value for the [default design](Form_design.md#defaultDesign) and can be overridden in the [`DESIGN` statement](DESIGN_statement.md).

    - `key`
     
        [String literal](Literals.md#strliteral) that defines a keyboard shortcut. The definition method is identical to that for a parameter in the Java class method [Keystroke.getKeystroke(String)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/KeyStroke.html#getKeyStroke(java.lang.String)).

    - `SHOW`
    
        A keyword. If specified, the keyboard shortcut will be displayed in the action caption. Used by default.

    - `HIDE`
     
        A keyword. If specified, the keyboard shortcut will not be displayed in the action caption. 

- `CONFIRM`

    Keyword. If specified, the user will be asked to confirm the action when it is executed. Sets the value for the default design and can be overridden in the `DESIGN` statement.
