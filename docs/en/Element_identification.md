title: 'Element identification'
---

On the **lsFusion** platform, some elements of the system are *named*, meaning that they can be used by accessing them by name.

Named system elements include: [properties](Properties.md), [actions](Actions.md), [user-defined classes](User_classes.md), [forms](Forms.md), [navigator elements](Navigator.md), [property groups](Groups_of_properties_and_actions.md), [windows](Navigator_design.md), [tables](Tables.md), [metacodes](Metaprogramming.md#metacode).

*Identification* of these elements is done using their [name](Naming.md), as well as, in some cases, taking the elements' semantics into account. Elements of the system are accessed according to the rules described in the article on [finding](Search_.md) elements.
