title: 'Properties'
---

A *property* is an element of the system that takes a set of objects (*parameters*) and returns exactly one object (the *return value*). 

The type and the specifics of how to calculate each property are determined by the [operator](Property_operators_paradigm.md) used to create the property.

### Type constraint {#type}

Due to implementation features, all non-`NULL` property values returned must be of the same type. That is, a property cannot return, for example, a string for one set of parameters and a number for another.

The same constraint exists for each property parameter: a property cannot have a non-`NULL` value for an object collection in which, for example, the first parameter is a string, and at the same time have a non-`NULL` value for another object collection, in which the first parameter is an object.

### Language

To create properties, use the [`=` statement](=_statement.md). 

### Examples

```lsf
// property defined by the context-independent DATA property operator
cost 'Cost' (i) = DATA NUMERIC[12,3] (Item);

// property defined by expression
weightedSum 'Weighted amount' (a, b) = 2*a + 3*b;

// the caption of this property will be 'diff' and the parameters will be (a, b)
diff = a - b;

// property defined by DATA operator with additional property options
teamName 'Team name' = DATA BPSTRING[30](Team) IN baseGroup TABLE team; 
```
