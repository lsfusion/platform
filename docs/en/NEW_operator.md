title: 'NEW operator'
---

The `NEW` operator creates an [action](Actions.md) that [creates objects](New_object_NEW.md) of the specified [class](Classes.md).

### Syntax

```
NEW className [WHERE whereExpr] [TO propertyId(prm1, ..., prmN)]
```

### Description

The `NEW` operator creates an action which creates objects of the specified class and writes them as the returned values of certain [properties](Properties.md). This operator can add its local [parameters](Actions.md) when defining a condition in the `WHERE` block. These parameters correspond to the objects being iterated for which the object will be created and are not parameters of the created action. 

The `TO` block is used to define the [data property](Data_properties_DATA.md) to which value the created object is written. 

:::info
There is a special option with the same name (`NEW`) in the [`FOR` operator](FOR_operator.md) for creating objects, and it is recommended to use it when possible.
:::

### Parameters

- `className`

    Name of the [custom](User_classes.md) class for the created objects. [Composite ID](IDs.md#cid).

- `whereExpr`

    An [expression](Expression.md) which value is the condition of the created action. In this expression you can both access already declared parameters and declare new local parameters.

- `propertyId`

    An [ID of the property](IDs.md#propertyid) to which value the created objects are written. If the property is not specified, then:

    - if the condition is not defined, it is automatically set to  `System.addedObject[]`
    - if the condition is defined, the created objects are not written anywhere

- `prm1, ..., prmN`

    A list of data property parameter names. You can use only the local parameters that were added in the `WHERE` block. The number of parameters in the list must be equal to the number of parameters of the data property. 

### Examples

```lsf

newSku ()  {
    LOCAL addedSkus = Sku (INTEGER);
    NEW Sku WHERE iterate(i, 1, 3) TO addedSkus(i);
    FOR Sku s = addedSkus(i) DO {
        id(s) <- 425;
        name(s) <- 'New Sku';
    }
}
```
