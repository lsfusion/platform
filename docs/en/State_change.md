title: 'State change'
---

System state change operators include the following.

-   [Property change (`CHANGE`)](Property_change_CHANGE.md)
-   [New object (`NEW`)](New_object_NEW.md)
-   [Class change (`DELETE` / `CHANGECLASS`)](Class_change_CHANGECLASS_DELETE.md)

In this case, we are talking about the state of the system in which the created action is executed. Interaction with external systems is included in the [user interaction](User_IS_interaction.md) section.
