title: 'Working parameters'
---

The platform working parameters can be set in one of the following ways (in the order of their priorities, lower priority at the bottom):

-   In Java code in the `lsfusion.server.physics.admin.Settings.java` file (relevant for platform forks)
-   In `lsfusion.properties` which are typically part of the project and therefore function for all installations by default - parameter name should start with `settings` (e.g., settings.enableUI)
-   In `conf/settings.properties` (for specific installations) - parameter name should start with `settings`
-   In [Java startup parameters](Launch_parameters.md#appjava) - parameter name should start with `D` prefix plus `settings` (e.g., `-Dsettings.enableUI=2`)
-   In the database: `Administration > System > Settings > Parameters`. In this interface, you can set both global settings and settings for specific roles
-   During the execution of an action using system actions: `Service.pushSetting[STRING, STRING]`, `Service.popSetting[STRING]` (overriding the value of the property for the entire current thread).

In addition to the system parameters, the platform also has [launch parameters](Launch_parameters.md) which are set a little differently and are relevant mainly for startup (initialization) processes of various components of the platform and access to these components.
