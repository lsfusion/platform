Forms let you combine different types of information for one or more objects in a single interface. Logically, aform can be divided into two parts:

-   [Form structure](Form_structure.md)  - defines what information (**what**) will be shown to the user.
-   [Form views](Form_views.md) - defines **how** it should be done.

In the user interface, a form is opened when a corresponding element is chosen in the [navigator](Navigator.md) or when an action created using a [corresponding operator](Open_form.md) is executed.
