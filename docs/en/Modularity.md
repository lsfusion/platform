title: 'Modularity'
---

Modularity is a key mechanism for providing extensibility, reusability, and effective interaction among the development team.

Any [project](Projects.md) developed on the **lsFusion** platform consists of a set of [modules](Modules.md), each of which implements a particular system functionality. Any module can extend the functionality of the modules on which it [depends](Modules.md#depends) using the special [extensions](Extensions.md) method.
