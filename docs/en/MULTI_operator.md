title: 'MULTI operator'
---

The `MULTI` operator creates a [property](Properties.md) that implements [selection](Selection_CASE_IF_MULTI_OVERRIDE_EXCLUSIVE.md#single) of one of the values (polymorphic form).

### Syntax

```
MULTI expr1, ..., exprN [exclusionType]
```

### Description

The `MULTI` operator creates a property which value will be the value of one of the properties specified in the operator. The property selection condition is that the parameters match this property [signature](ISCLASS_operator.md). 

### Parameters

- `expr1, ..., exprN`  

    A list of [expressions](Expression.md) defining the properties from which the selection is made.

- `exclusionType`

    [Type of mutual exclusion](Selection_CASE_IF_MULTI_OVERRIDE_EXCLUSIVE.md#exclusive). Determines whether several conditions for the property selection can be met simultaneously with a certain set of parameters. It is specified by one of the keywords:

    - `EXCLUSIVE`
    - `OVERRIDE`

  The `EXCLUSIVE` type indicates that the conditions for the property selection cannot be met simultaneously. The `OVERRIDE` type allows several conditions to be met simultaneously, in which case the first property in the list which selection condition is met will be selected. 

    The `EXCLUSIVE` type is used by default.

### Examples

```lsf
nameMulti (Human h) = MULTI 'Male' IF h IS Male, 'Female' IF h IS Female;

CLASS Ledger;
CLASS InLedger : Ledger;
quantity = DATA INTEGER (InLedger);

CLASS OutLedger : Ledger;
quantity = DATA INTEGER (OutLedger);

signedQuantity (Ledger l) = MULTI quantity[InLedger](l), quantity[OutLedger](l);
```
