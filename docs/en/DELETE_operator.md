title: 'DELETE operator'
---

The `DELETE` operator creates an [action](Actions.md) that [deletes objects](Class_change_CHANGECLASS_DELETE.md).

### Syntax

```
DELETE expr [WHERE whereExpr]
```

### Description

The `DELETE` operator creates an action that deletes objects for which a certain condition is met. This operator can add its local [parameter](Actions.md), which will correspond to the objects being iterated. In this case, the `WHERE` block is mandatory. 

### Parameters

- `expr`

    An [expression](Expression.md) or [typed parameter](IDs.md#paramid). You can either use an already declared parameter as a typed parameter, or declare a new local parameter. When using an expression, new local parameters cannot be added.

- `whereExpr`

    An [expression](Expression.md) whose value is for the action being created. If not set, it is considered as equal to `TRUE`.

### Examples

```lsf
// deleting an object
deleteObject(obj)  { DELETE obj; }

// deleting all inactive products
CLASS Article;
active = DATA BOOLEAN (Article);
deleteInactiveArticles()  {
    // a local parameter a is added corresponding to the objects to be iterated over
    DELETE Article a WHERE a IS Article AND NOT active(a); 
}
```
