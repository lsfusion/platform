*Extension* is a technique that allows a developer to extend the functionality of one module in another. 

The **lsFusion** platform supports extension of [classes](Class_extension.md), [properties](Property_extension.md), [actions](Action_extension.md) and [forms](Form_extension.md). All the described mechanisms can also be used within a single module in order to change the initialization order of system elements. 


:::info
It is worth noting that almost all other platform constructs (for example, the [navigator](Navigator.md) or [shape design](Form_design.md)) are extensible by definition, so there is no separate extension logic for them.
