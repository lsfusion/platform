title: 'NEWTHREAD operator'
---

The `NEWTHREAD` operator creates an [action](Actions.md) that executes another action in a [new thread](New_threads_NEWTHREAD_NEWEXECUTOR.md).

### Syntax

```
NEWTHREAD action [CONNECTION connectionExpr]
NEWTHREAD action SCHEDULE [PERIOD periodExpr] [DELAY delayExpr]
```

### Description

The `NEWTHREAD` operator creates an action that executes another action in a new thread. When the `CONNECTION` keyword is used, you can specify the connection which will be used during the action execution. There is also a second form of the `NEWTHREAD` operator for triggering an action using the scheduler. This form usage is determined by the presence of the `SCHEDULE` keyword.  

### Parameters

- `action`

    A [context dependent operator](Action_operators.md#contextdependent) that defines an action to be executed in the new thread.

- `connectionExpr`

    An [expression](Expression.md) which value is a [property](Properties.md) that returns an object of the `SystemEvents.Connection` class. Defines the connection for which this action will be performed.  

- `periodExpr`

    An expression which value is a property that returns the length of the action repetition period in milliseconds. If not specified, the action will be executed once.

- `delayExpr`

    An expression which value is a property that returns the delay before the first execution of the action in milliseconds. If not specified, the action will be executed without delay.

### Examples

```lsf
testNewThread ()  {
    //Showing messages 'Message' to all
    FOR user(Connection conn) AND connectionStatus(conn) == ConnectionStatus.connectedConnection AND conn != currentConnection() DO {
        NEWTHREAD MESSAGE 'Message'; CONNECTION conn;
    }

    //Execution of the 'action' action with a frequency of 10 seconds and a delay of 5 seconds
    NEWTHREAD MESSAGE 'Hello World'; SCHEDULE PERIOD 10000 DELAY 5000;
}
```
