The paradigm can be divided into two parts:

### [Logical model](Logical_model.md)

Describes the functionality of the system itself, that is, what the system can do, what data is input and what data is output.

### [Physical model](Physical_model.md)

Includes everything else - everything related to the development, performance improvement and management of a working system.
