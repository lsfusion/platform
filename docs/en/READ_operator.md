title: 'READ operator'
---

The `READ` operator creates an [action](Actions.md) that [reads a file](Read_file_READ.md) to a [property](Properties.md) from an external resource.

### Syntax

```
READ [CLIENT [DIALOG]] urlExpr [TO propertyId]
```

### Description

The `READ` operator creates an action that reads a file from an external resource at the URL specified, and then writes the result file to the specified property.

The following URL types are supported: 

```
[file://]path_to_file
[s]ftp://username:password[;charset]@host:port[/path_to_file][?passivemode=true|false]
```

If the value of the property to which the file is written belongs to the `FILE` class, the file extension from the URL is also written to its value along with the file.

### Parameters

- `CLIENT`

    Keyword. If specified, the action will be executed on the client side. By default, the action is executed on the server.

- `DIALOG`

    Keyword. If specified, before writing the file a dialog will be shown in which the user can change the specified URL. This can be used only when writing to the disk (the URL type is file). By default, the dialog is not shown. 

- `urlExpr`

    An [expression](Expression.md) whose value is the URL from which to read. The value of the expression must be a string type.

- `propertyId`

    The [ID of the property](IDs.md#propertyid) to which read data should be written. This property must not have parameters and its value must be of a file class (`FILE`, `RAWFILE`, `JSONFILE`, etc.). If this property is not specified, the `System.exportFile` property is used by default.

### Examples

```lsf
readFiles()  {

    LOCAL importFile = FILE ();

    //reading from FTP
    READ 'ftp://ftp.lsfusion.org/file.xlsx' TO importFile;
    //reading from SFTP
    READ 'sftp://sftp.lsfusion.org/file.xlsx' TO importFile;
    //reading from FILE
    READ 'D://lsfusion/file.xlsx' TO importFile;
    READ 'file://D://lsfusion/file.xlsx' TO importFile;
}

connectionString = DATA STRING[100]();
importXls 'Import markups'()  {
    LOCAL importFile = FILE ();
    READ connectionString() + '@SELECT field1, field2 FROM myTable' TO importFile;

    LOCAL field1 = INTEGER (INTEGER);
    LOCAL field2 = BPSTRING[10] (INTEGER);
    IMPORT TABLE FROM importFile() TO field1, field2;
}
```
