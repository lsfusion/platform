## Example 1

### Task

We have a certain set of cities associated with their countries.

```lsf
CLASS Country 'Country';
id 'Code' = DATA STRING[20] (Country) IN id;
name 'Name' = DATA ISTRING[100] (Country) IN id;

country (STRING[20] id) = GROUP AGGR Country c BY id(c);

CLASS City 'City';
name 'Name' = DATA ISTRING[100] (City) IN id;

country 'Country' = DATA Country (City);
nameCountry 'Country' (City c) = name(country(c));

FORM cities 'Cities'
    OBJECTS c = City
    PROPERTIES(c) name, nameCountry, NEW, DELETE
;

NAVIGATOR {
    NEW cities;
}
```

We need to send an HTTP request for adding a city in the JSON format to a certain url.

### Solution

```lsf
postCity 'Send' (City c)  {
    EXPORT JSON FROM countryId = id(country(c)), name = name(c);

    LOCAL result = FILE();
    EXTERNAL HTTP 'http://localhost:7651/exec?action=Location.createCity' PARAMS exportFile() TO result;

    LOCAL code = STRING[10]();
    LOCAL message = STRING[100]();
    IMPORT JSON FROM result() TO() code, message;
    IF NOT code() == '0' THEN {
        MESSAGE 'Error: ' + message();
    }
}

EXTEND FORM cities
    PROPERTIES(c) postCity
;
```

The [`EXPORT` operator](Data_export_EXPORT.md) will create a JSON in the [`FILE`](Built-in_classes.md) format and then will write it to the `exportFile` property. Here is an example of the generated file:
 
```json
{"countryId":"123","name":"San Francisco"}
```

Then we call the [`EXTERNAL` operator](Access_to_an_external_system_EXTERNAL.md), which sends a request to the specified url passing there the contents of the generated file as Body. In this case, since the property in the `FROM` block has the type JSON, *application/json* will be used as the content type. `<namespace>.<property name>` is encoded in the url. In this case, the namespace of the action being called `createCity` is `Location`. All parameters are passed consequently with the ID `p`. The response from the server will be written to the `result` property. Suppose that the response is received in the JSON format and has one of the following types:
```json
{"code":"0","message":"OK"}

{"code":"1","message":"Invalid country code"}
```

The response is handled by the [`IMPORT` operator](Data_import_IMPORT.md) which parses the corresponding parameters into the `code` and `message` properties respectively. If any error occurs, the user will see a corresponding error message.

## Example 2

### Task

Similar to [**Example 1**](#example-1). 

We need to handle the incoming HTTP request and create a new city in the database with the parameters provided in the request.

### Solution

```lsf
createCity (FILE f)  {

    LOCAL cy = STRING[20] ();
    LOCAL ne = STRING[100] ();

    IMPORT JSON FROM f AS FILE TO() cy = countryId, ne = name;

    IF NOT country(cy()) THEN {
        EXPORT JSON FROM code = '1', message = 'Invalid country code';
        RETURN;
    }

    NEW c = City {
        name(c) <- ne();
        country(c) <- country(cy());

        APPLY;
    }

    EXPORT JSON FROM code = '0', message = 'OK';
}
```

Since the property is named `createCity` and located in the [module](Modules.md) with the namespace `Location`, the url on which the request will be handled looks like this:

```
http://localhost:7651/exec?action=Location.createCity
```

Body of the HTTP request will be passed as a parameter of the type `FILE`. The values read from the `countryId` and `name` parameters are written to the local properties `cy` and `ne` respectively.

If there is no country with the corresponding code, then a JSON file is generated similar to that described in the previous example, and the [`RETURN` operator](Exit_RETURN.md) is called to abort execution. By default, the response message value is also stored in the `exportFile` property.

If all the actions are completed successfully, the corresponding "OK message" is generated in response.

## Example 3

### Task

We have the logic of book orders.

```lsf
CLASS Book 'Book';
id 'Code' = DATA STRING[10] (Book) IN id;
name 'Name' = DATA ISTRING[100] (Book) IN id;

book (STRING[10] id) = GROUP AGGR Book b BY id(b);

CLASS Order 'Order';
date 'Date' = DATA DATE (Order);
number 'Number' = DATA STRING[10] (Order);

CLASS OrderDetail 'Order line';
order 'Order' = DATA Order (OrderDetail) NONULL DELETE;

book 'Book' = DATA Book (OrderDetail) NONULL;
nameBook 'Book' (OrderDetail d) = name(book(d));

quantity 'Quantity' = DATA INTEGER (OrderDetail);
price 'Price' = DATA NUMERIC[14,2] (OrderDetail);

FORM order 'Order'
    OBJECTS o = Order PANEL
    PROPERTIES(o) date, number

    OBJECTS d = OrderDetail
    PROPERTIES(d) nameBook, quantity, price, NEW, DELETE
    FILTERS order(d) == o

    EDIT Order OBJECT o
;

FORM orders 'Orders'
    OBJECTS i = Order
    PROPERTIES(i) READONLY date, number
    PROPERTIES(i) NEWSESSION NEW, EDIT, DELETE
;

NAVIGATOR {
    NEW orders;
}
```

We need to send an HTTP request for creating a new order in the JSON format to a certain url.

### Solution

```lsf
FORM exportOrder
    OBJECTS order = Order PANEL
    PROPERTIES dt = date(order), nm = number(order)

    OBJECTS detail = OrderDetail
    PROPERTIES id = id(book(detail)), qn = quantity(detail), pr = price(detail)
    FILTERS order(detail) == order
;

exportOrder 'Send' (Order o)  {
    EXPORT exportOrder OBJECTS order = o JSON;

    LOCAL result = FILE();
    EXTERNAL HTTP 'http://localhost:7651/exec?action=Location.importOrder' PARAMS exportFile() TO result;
}

EXTEND FORM orders
    PROPERTIES(i) exportOrder;
;
```

To create a JSON with nested tags, we need to create a form with the corresponding objects linked via the `FILTERS` block of operators. Based on the dependencies between objects, the system will generate a JSON file with the corresponding structure. In the considering example, the output JSON structure will look like this:
```json
{
   "dt":"20.08.18",
   "nm":"1",
   "detail":[
      {
         "pr":5.99,
         "id":"b1",
         "qn":3
      },
      {
         "pr":6.99,
         "id":"b2",
         "qn":2
      }
   ]
}
```

We do not create a custom tag for `order`, since the object value is passed as an argument to the `EXPORT` operator.  
In this example, the response to the HTTP request is ignored.

## Example 4

### Task

Similar to [**Example 3**](#example-3). 

We need to handle the incoming HTTP request and create a new order in the database with the parameters provided in the request.

### Solution

```lsf
date = DATA LOCAL DATE();
number = DATA LOCAL STRING[10]();

id = DATA LOCAL STRING[10] (INTEGER);
quantity = DATA LOCAL INTEGER (INTEGER);
price = DATA LOCAL NUMERIC[14,2] (INTEGER);
FORM importOrder
    PROPERTIES dt = date(), nm = number()

    OBJECTS detail = INTEGER
    PROPERTIES id = id(detail), qn = quantity(detail), pr = price(detail)
;

importOrder (FILE f)  {
    IMPORT importOrder JSON FROM f;

    NEW o = Order {
        date(o) <- date();
        number(o) <- number();
        FOR id(INTEGER detail) DO NEW d = OrderDetail {
            order(d) <- o;
            book(d) <- book(id(detail));
            quantity(d) <- quantity(detail);
            price(d) <- price(detail);
        }

        APPLY;
    }
}
```

To import the corresponding file in the JSON format, we need to create a form of a similar structure, except that the `INTEGER` type will be used as object classes. During the import process, the tag values will be placed in the properties with the corresponding names. The `date` and `number` properties have no parameters, since their values in JSON are provided at the topmost level.

## Example 5

### Task

Similar to [**Example 4**](#example-4). 

We need to send an HTTP request to create an order in the JSON format to a certain url as in the previous example, except that everything must be wrapped in the `order` tag.

### Solution

```lsf
GROUP order;
FORM exportOrderNew
    OBJECTS o = Order
    PROPERTIES IN order dt = date(o), nm = number(o)

    OBJECTS detail = OrderDetail IN order
    PROPERTIES id = id(book(detail)), qn = quantity(detail), pr = price(detail)
    FILTERS order(detail) == o
;

exportOrderNew 'Send (new)' (Order o)  {
    EXPORT exportOrderNew OBJECTS o = o JSON;

    LOCAL result = FILE();
    EXTERNAL HTTP 'http://localhost:7651/exec?action=Location.importOrderNew' PARAMS exportFile() TO result;
}

EXTEND FORM orders
    PROPERTIES(i) exportOrderNew;
;
```

  

Unlike the previous example, here we create a property [group](Groups_of_properties_and_actions.md) named `order` using the [`GROUP` operator](GROUP_operator.md). When declaring a form, we put all the properties of the purchase order as well as the `detail` object into this property group. The result JSON will look like this:
```json
{
   "order":{
      "dt":"20.08.18",
      "nm":"1",
      "detail":[
         {
            "pr":5.99,
            "id":"b1",
            "qn":3
         },
         {
            "pr":6.99,
            "id":"b2",
            "qn":2
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

## Example 6

### Task

Similar to [**Example 5**](#example-5). 

We need to handle the incoming HTTP request and create a new order in the database with the parameters provided in the request.

### Solution

```lsf
FORM importOrderNew
    PROPERTIES IN order dt = date(), nm = number()

    OBJECTS detail = INTEGER IN order
    PROPERTIES id = id(detail), qn = quantity(detail), pr = price(detail)
;

importOrderNew (FILE f)  {
    IMPORT importOrderNew JSON FROM f;

    NEW o = Order {
        date(o) <- date();
        number(o) <- number();
        FOR id(INTEGER detail) DO NEW d = OrderDetail {
            order(d) <- o;
            book(d) <- book(id(detail));
            quantity(d) <- quantity(detail);
            price(d) <- price(detail);
        }

        APPLY;
    }
}
```

Just as in the export process, we put all the properties and the `detail` object to the `order` group to correctly receive the new version of JSON.

## Example 7

### Task

Similar to [**Example 3**](#example-3). 

We need to return a list of order numbers for a given date using an HTTP GET request in which this date is provided.

### Solution

```lsf
FORM exportOrders
    OBJECTS date = DATE PANEL

    OBJECTS order = Order
    PROPERTIES nm = number(order)
    FILTERS date(order) = date
;

getOrdersByDate (DATE d) {
    EXPORT exportOrders OBJECTS date = d JSON;
}
```

The url to which the HTTP request should be sent will look like this: `http://localhost:7651/exec?action=Location.getOrdersByDate&p=12.11.2018`.

The response JSON will look like this:

```json  
{
    "order": [
        {
            "nm": "42"
        },
        {
            "nm": "65"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Example 8

### Task

Similar to [**Example 3**](#example 3).

For each order, there is a list of files attached to it.
```lsf
CLASS Attachment 'Attachment';
order = DATA Order (Attachment) NONULL DELETE;
name 'Name' = DATA STRING (Attachment);
file = DATA FILE (Attachment);
```
We need to implement HTTP GET request that will return for the passed internal identifier of the order its parameters and a list of files.
In addition, we need to implement a separate request to retrieve the content of a specific file.  

### Solution
```lsf
FORM orderAttachments
    OBJECTS o = Order
    PROPERTIES(o) number, date

    OBJECTS attachments = Attachment
    PROPERTIES id = VALUE(attachments), name(attachments)
;

getOrderAttachments (LONG orderId) {
    FOR LONG(Order o AS Order) = orderId DO {
        EXPORT orderAttachments OBJECTS o = o JSON;
    }
}
```
To generate an HTTP request, use the following url : http://localhost:7651/exec?action=getOrderAttachments&p=32178.
In it _p_ parameter contains internal order identifier.

The response will return for example the following JSON :
```json
{
    "date": "20.10.2021",
    "number": "12",
    "attachments": [
        {
            "name": "File 1",
            "id": 32180
        },
        {
            "name": "File 2",
            "id": 32183
        }
    ]
}
```

The _id_ attributes will contain internal file identifiers. The contents of these files can then be read by a query using the following url :
http://localhost:7651/exec?action=getOrderAttachment&p=32180. The _getOrderAttachment_ action is declared as follows :

```lsf
getOrderAttachment (LONG id) {
    FOR LONG(Attachment a AS Attachment) = id DO
        exportFile() <- file(a); 
}
```
The query will return a file with _Content-Type_ corresponding to the extension of the _file_ property.
